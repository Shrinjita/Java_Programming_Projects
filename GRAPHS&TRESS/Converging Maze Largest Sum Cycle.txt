Converging Maze: Largest Sum Cycle

You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points, but at most one exit (i.e., entry/exit points are unidirectional, like valves).
The cells are numbered from 0 to N-1.

You need to find the sum of the largest sum cycle in the maze.
Return -1 if there are no cycles.

The sum of a cycle is the sum of the indices of all the nodes involved in that cycle.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N, the number of cells.

The second line contains N integers, where edge[i] indicates the cell that can be reached from cell i in one step.

If edge[i] = -1, it means cell i has no exit.

Output Format:
Print a single integer: the sum of the largest sum cycle.

Print -1 if there are no cycles.
