Converging Maze: Maximum Weight Node
Problem Description
You are given a maze with N cells. Each cell may have multiple entry points, but at most one exit (i.e., entry/exit points are unidirectional doors, like valves).
The cells are numbered from 0 to N-1.

Your task is to:

Find the node number of the maximum weight node.

Weight of a node is defined as the sum of the node numbers of all nodes that point to it.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case:

The first line contains an integer N, the number of cells.

The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the edge[] array:

edge[i] is the index of the cell that can be reached from cell i in one step.

edge[i] = -1 means cell i has no exit.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the node number with the maximum weight.

If multiple nodes have the same weight, return the one with the highest node number.
